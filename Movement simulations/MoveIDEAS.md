# Mode IDEAS
## Program step through
 - User selects 1 of 4 movement scripts
 - Script welcomes the user
 - Script loads assets
 - User can play the game
 - User can change values in game or quit and change

## Requirements
 - There should be multiple programs that demonstrates movement in different directions of different sizes
 - Different factors that affect the movement will be changeable in program or out of program

 - Attempt to separate game scripts and their movement/physics code into a shared script

## Examples
 - Football game            - Users can kick a ball into goal and its movement can be changed
 - Space gravity simulation - Simulation of people and objects in space and a platform which users can change gravity to affect their movement
 - Racing game              - Users race with each other and can change aspects like speed and gravity for traction
 - Random object playground - Users are given random objects to place, remove or move and see how they interact
