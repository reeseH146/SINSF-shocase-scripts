# A bunch of ideas for animations
 - Welcome screen which has a series of animations users can choose and explains how animations work
 - During runtime, users can : 
   - Change animation speed with horizontal arrow keybinds
   - Change position of animations with mouse button, "space" to reset
   - Change size of animations with vertical arrow keybinds, scales in place
 - Default values define the running of the program which the users can change before runtime
 - Program guide - explains to the user how to use the program and keybinds
 - Animation guide - step by step explains what animations are and how to implement them in 2D

 - There are different animations of different sizes and speed so they will have different attributes to set
 - Program will have to load different animations

 - Animation ideas : 
   - Wave - Crashing ocean wave which curls into itself
   - Bouncing ball - Ball will have air trail and can deform/stretch in animation
   - Trig waves - San, Cos, Trig, placement cannot be changed

# Was going to have other animations like cams, duck waddling and non ASCII doughnut but too much work
