# SINSF-showcase-scripts
Some simple programs which will be demonstrated and used to teach programming to people visiting the Sir Issac Newton Sixth Form.
There are a number of programs made based on different categories which will teach or demonstrate different aspects of programming.
Things people may want to know more about :
 - Programming
 - Pygame
 - RPI
 - Coursework
 - Theory in lessons
There are other projects hosted : 
 - Reese's fighting game - Larger program in pygame which users can play with or ask about development/use of pygame, not included with the repo
 - Sam's RPI project allows people to play a game involving a light strip and a light gate. A dot would move back and forth along the strip, and players would have to trigger the light gate as close to the target dot as possible. Could use multiple rounds with changing patterns for the light. Run on a Pico.

# Requirements
 - Majority of programs will use Pygame to handle UI related aspects
 - Movement / Physic - A series of games or simulations include different ways sprites can move based on different physics which is preset but users can change these default values and inspect the code to experiment
 - Animations demonstration - Users can change animation speed and size
 - Teaches programming - Demonstrates basic constructs and ideas of programming and gets users to complete different programming challenges based on difficulty like Time2Code or Parson's Problems
 - A-Level OCR CS Year 1 algorithms - Visualises sorting and searching of data for users
 - Sam's RPI project, see above for details.

# Movement / Physics
 - Different 2D games/simulations which visualises different movements and their factors
 - Use SUVAT and maybe vectors to calculate movement
 - Example programs :
   - Football game            - Users can kick a ball into goal and its movement can be changed
   - Space gravity simulation - Simulation of people and objects in space and a platform which users can change gravity to affect their movement
   - Racing game              - Users race with each other and can change aspects like speed and gravity for traction
   - Random object playground - Users are given random objects to place, remove or move and see how they interact

# Animation demonstration
 - Have animations before hand that the user can look at
 - Variables that affect the speed and size of animations

---

# Teaches programming
 - Introduce basic structures : Sequence, selection, iteration
 - Introduce python syntax : print, def
 - Introduce python data structures and types (casting) : int, list
 - Demonstrate use of structure in examples
 - Sets of mini codes users can create using blocks and then typing

# Algorithms
## Search algorithms
 - Explains how the search works and then steps through
 - Linear search
 - Binary search

## Sort algorithms
 - Bubble sort
 - Insertion sort

# Workflow and rules
 - When editing any files in global scope in main pull request the changes instead of pushing and commiting
 - Only Reese and Sam are allowed to push and commit any changes
 - Other contributors cannot change README files and can only edit the "Teaching programming" folder
